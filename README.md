  # IP address
- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing devices to communicate with each other. It can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.10) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

| Type         | Example       | Scope / Use Case                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Private**  | 192.168.1.10  | Local LAN (home, office)              |
| **Public**   | 103.25.231.88 | Internet-facing, ISP-assigned         |
| **Static**   | 203.0.113.25  | Fixed server IP (websites, VPNs, DNS) |
| **Dynamic**  | 103.45.68.90  | ISP-assigned, changes periodically    |
| **Loopback** | 127.0.0.1     | Testing on your own device            |
| **APIPA**    | 169.254.45.10 | Self-assigned when DHCP fails         |
# MAC address
- A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) for communication on a physical network segment. Unlike IP addresses, which can change depending on the network, a MAC address is hardware-based and usually permanent (burned into the device by the manufacturer).

üîπ Key Points:

- **Format:** 6 pairs of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons or hyphens  
  Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` or `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`
- **Length:** 48 bits (6 bytes)
- ### TCP vs UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two core transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP model. They both transmit data over networks but have fundamental differences.

| Feature                | TCP                                     | UDP                                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Full Name**          | Transmission Control Protocol           | User Datagram Protocol                  |
| **Type**               | Connection-oriented                     | Connectionless                          |
| **Reliability**        | Reliable (guaranteed delivery)          | Unreliable (no guarantee)               |
| **Error Checking**      | Checks for errors and retransmits lost packets | Checks for errors but does not retransmit |
| **Order of Data**      | Preserves the order of packets          | Packets may arrive out of order         |
| **Speed**              | Slower due to handshakes and retransmissions | Faster, minimal overhead               |
| **Use Cases**          | Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP), File Transfer (FTP) | Streaming (video/audio), DNS, VoIP     |
| **Connection**         | Requires a 3-way handshake to establish connection | No handshake needed                     |
| **Flow Control**       | Supported                               | Not supported                           |
| **Header Size**        | 20 bytes minimum                        | 8 bytes minimum                         |
- TCP is reliable, ordered, and heavier; suitable for applications where data integrity is critical.  
- UDP is fast, lightweight, but less reliable; suitable for real-time applications like streaming, gaming, and VoIP.

- DNS Record Types

 

- DNS isn't just for websites though, and multiple types of DNS record exist. We'll go over some of the most common ones that you're likely to come across.

- A Record

- These records resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229

- AAAA Record

- These records resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example 2606:4700:20::681a:be5
CNAME Record

- These records resolve to another domain name, for example, TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com. Another DNS request would then be made to shops.shopify.com to work out the  - IP address.

- MX Record

- These records resolve to the address of the servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying, for example an MX record response for tryhackme.com would look something like alt1.aspmx.l.google.com. These records also come with a priority - flag. This tells the client in which order to try the servers, this is perfect for if the main server goes down and email needs to be sent to a backup server.

- TXT Record

 

- TXT records are free text fields where any text-based data can be stored. TXT records have multiple uses, but some common ones can be to list servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf of the domain (this can help in the battle against spam and spoofed email). They can also be used to verify ownership of the domain name when signing up for third party services.

| Feature        | Nmap                                             | ZMap                                             |

| Detail Level   | Very detailed (services, versions, OS, scripts, vulnerabilities) | Very basic (just tells if a port is open/responding) |
| Scanning Model | Stateful (completes handshakes, tracks sessions) | Stateless (fires probes, listens for replies) |
| Accuracy       | High (fewer false positives, more reliable)    | Fast but less accurate (can miss things or produce false positives) |
| Output         | Services, versions, vulnerabilities, scripts   | List of IPs that responded on a given port   |

# OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì 2021 (A01 to A07)

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for web application security.  
It highlights the 10 most critical security risks for web apps based on real-world data and expert consensus.  
Organizations and developers use it as a guideline to prioritize security fixes.

---

## A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control
**Definition:** Users can access data or perform actions they shouldn‚Äôt be able to.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers can modify URLs, API calls, or cookies to gain admin privileges or access other users‚Äô data.  

**Examples:**
- URL manipulation: `/user/1234/orders` ‚Üí changing `1234` to another user ID to see their data.  
- Bypassing role checks in APIs.  

**Mitigation:** Enforce server-side authorization checks; never rely solely on client-side restrictions.  

---

## A02:2021 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures
**Definition:** Sensitive data is not properly protected in storage or transit.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers can steal credentials, personal info, or payment data.  

**Examples:**
- Storing passwords in plain text instead of hashing with bcrypt/argon2.  
- Using outdated TLS/SSL protocols.  

**Mitigation:** Use strong encryption, secure key management, HTTPS everywhere, and proper hashing for passwords.  

---

## A03:2021 ‚Äì Injection
**Definition:** User input is not sanitized and is executed by the server.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers can manipulate SQL, NoSQL, OS, or LDAP commands to access or destroy data.  

**Examples:**
- **SQL Injection:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$input'` ‚Üí attacker enters `' OR 1=1--`.  
- **Command Injection:** Passing unsanitized user input to `system()` or `exec()`.  

**Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries, input validation, and ORM frameworks.  

---

## A04:2021 ‚Äì Insecure Design
**Definition:** Security flaws stemming from application design and architecture rather than coding errors.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Even with secure code, weak design can lead to vulnerabilities.  

**Examples:**
- No multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions.  
- Poor session management leading to session hijacking.  

**Mitigation:** Threat modeling during design; secure coding principles.  

---

## A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration
**Definition:** Improperly configured servers, databases, frameworks, or default accounts.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers exploit default passwords or exposed interfaces.  

**Examples:**
- Default admin accounts enabled on CMS like WordPress.  
- Verbose error messages revealing internal structure.  

**Mitigation:** Harden servers, remove default accounts, and regularly audit configurations.  

---

## A06:2021 ‚Äì Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Definition:** Using software libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers exploit known CVEs to compromise the system.  

**Examples:**
- Using old jQuery with XSS vulnerabilities.  
- Outdated CMS plugins with remote code execution flaws.  

**Mitigation:** Keep components updated; monitor CVEs.  

---

## A07:2021 ‚Äì Identification & Authentication Failures
**Definition:** Weak authentication mechanisms or improperly implemented account management.  
**Why it‚Äôs risky:** Attackers can take over user accounts or perform privilege escalation.  

**Examples:**
- No rate limiting on login attempts ‚Üí brute-force attacks.  
- Weak passwords or predictable password reset tokens.  

**Mitigation:** Implement MFA, strong password policies, secure password reset flows.
